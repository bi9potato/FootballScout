# Improvement
In milestone 4, our group has completed the implementation of all panels and made improvements in the following areas:

For the whole app:
1. Add the spinner component to show the user the loading spinning icon when opening the website data for loading.
2. Optimize the data, shrink the data set, and eliminate all data with 0 appearances in the data set to further improve the data validity and web operation speed.

Panel 1:
1. Add "Age Range" to select palayers age.
2. Once the "Team" is selected, "Age Range" and "Year Range" are automatically adjusted to meet the available conditions based on the team's information. 

Panel 2:
When Players are selected, the Year Range will be automatically adjusted according to the Players' information.

# Things to optimize

For the whole app:
When you select sliders(Year Range, Age Range) and drop downs(League, Team) in Panel 1, the corresponding sliders and drop downs in Panel 2 and Panel 3 will be adjusted accordingly and the user does not need to select them again

For Panel3: 
In order to make it easier for users to get information about the player's prediction, we can add a summary conclusion about the player's prediction based on the player's performance and other information obtained in panel1 and panel2, combined with the prediction results of the player in Panel 3.
